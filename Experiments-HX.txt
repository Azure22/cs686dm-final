People are commenting about movies on different kinds of social media. These comments could be clue on what people are actually thinking about this movie. Movie makers or Theaters would like to analysis this to decide whether they will make it a series or keep it showing for more days. Our task is to analyze the sentiments of movie comments in order to get a average score about this movie. This is an existing project here called <Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Reviews >[http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/homework/finalProject.html#ideas], but we modified a little bit. Our project is focusing on two parts: first we need to calculate the sentiment score on each word using the training data, and then we can classify the test data by these scores.

In detail, we plan to create a new algorithm (or combine several existing algorithms together like tf-idf and maybe Naive Bayes) to score the words. We can compare the score we generated with the existing one to see which one works better iunder the same classification algorithm.

An then, if we have time, we will use the previous result to classify each comment in the test data into positive/negative sentiment using different classification algorithms and compare their test accuracy.

Our data comes from the existing dataset in the project description here [http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz]. These are comments which were labeled into different sentiment type: positive, negative and not clear. We don't have to change something in the data, but we have to parse each comment file into a word set. Besides, this dataset contains 25000 training examples and 25000 test examples, which is a very large one.
